## 🧠 About Me

I'm a computer science student with a focus on web development, database systems, and software engineering.  
I enjoy designing and developing user-friendly systems that create impact in local communities — from farm management to weather encryption.

In my journey, I’ve worked on:
- **E-commerce platforms** for local farmers and customers
- **Pig farming management systems** with modules for health, breeding, and finances
- **Data encryption tools** for weather forecast documents
- **Various academic and personal coding projects** using PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Python, and JavaScript

I'm always open to collaboration, freelancing opportunities, and contributing to open-source.
